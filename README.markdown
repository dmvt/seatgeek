SeatGeek [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ticketevolution/seatgeek.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ticketevolution/seatgeek)
========
SeatGeek maintains a canonical directory of live events in the United States. The SeatGeek Platform makes it easy to construct applications that help users find and discover events by exposing the wealth of data and powerful search behind SeatGeek.com in an easy-to-consume format.

This Gem is designed to be a platform agnostic wrapper around the SeatGeek Platform API. Enjoy it and please let me know about anything really cool which uses it.

For more information, including a detailed description of the functionality available, visit [The SeatGeek Platform documentation site](http://platform.seatgeek.com).
